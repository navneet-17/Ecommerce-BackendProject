Introduction to Unit Testing:

-> Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
Importance of Unit Testing:
-> Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually but is often automated.


***************** Test- Driven Development (TDD): ************************
-> Test- Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very 	short development cycle:
-> First the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function,
-> Then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and
-> Finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.

**** Flaky Tests **********************
-> A flaky test is a test that is not consistently passing or failing, but rather both, for the same code. This is usually due to the test depending on some kind of external state, which is hard to control and might change unexpectedly.
-> Flaky tests are a problem because they make it harder to trust the test suite. If a test fails, you want to be sure that it's because of a real problem in the code, not because of some flaky test. If a test is flaky, it's hard to know whether a failure is a real failure or not.
-> Flaky tests are also a problem because they make it harder to trust the code. If a test is flaky, it's hard to know whether a failure is a real failure or not. If a test is flaky, it's hard to know whether a failure is a real failure or not.
Flaky Tests happen because of the following reasons:
-> The test depends on some kind of external state, which is hard to control and might change unexpectedly.
1. Concurrency: If the test is not thread-safe, it might fail when run in parallel with other tests.
2. Time: If the test depends on the current time, it might fail if the test runs too close to a time boundary.
3. Randomness: If the test depends on a random number generator, it might fail if the generator produces an unexpected value.

*****************************************************************
Let's say if in future the getProductById implementation changes.
 For example, instead of returning null when the product is not found, it returns an empty generic product dto.
 This will break the code of all the clients that are using the getProductsById.
 To avoid this, we can write a test for the getProductsById method.
This test will ensure that the getProductsById method returns a product when the product is found and throws an exception when the product is not found.
***********************************************************************

Implementing Unit Tests to demonstrate Flaky tests:
---- We are writing the test under the src/test/java/dev/navneet/productservice/RandomTest.java file.

@SpringBootTest
public class RandomTest {
    @Test
    void testLessThan3() {
        Random random = new Random();
        int number = random.nextInt();
        System.out.println(number);
        assert(number < 10000000);
    }
}
As we can see, the test is using the Random class to generate a random number and then asserting that the number is less than 10000000.
If we run the test multiple times, we will see that the test is passing sometimes and failing sometimes.
This is because the Random class is generating a random number every time the test is run.
So, the test is not deterministic and is failing sometimes and passing sometimes.
This is an example of a flaky test.

-> In this class, we will learn about the different types of testing and how to write unit tests for them.
-> We will also learn about the different types of assertions that we can use in our unit tests.

1.	Integration Testing:
A typical S/w system has to work with db., 3rd party APIs, cache etc.
Integration tests how a system works wit a 3rd apart API as well

Assertion Frameworks:
-> An assertion is a statement that a condition is always true at that point in the program.
-> Assertions are used to test the correctness of the program.
-> In Java, we can use the assert keyword to write assertions.
-> The assert keyword is used to test the correctness of the program.

# common assert methods:
1.	assert(condition)
2.	assertTrue(condition, msg)
3.	assertEquals(expected, actual, msg)
4.	assertNull(condition)
5.	assertThrows(exception.class, object)
assertThrows is used to assert if the exception that we are throwing from our code is working as expected.

Detailed notes of teh class is made in the word doc.
