-Product Controller talks to a service.
-Service has the business logic.

Rule of Thumb:
- If a Controller needs to talk to a service, we need to create an interface for the service.
    This is because we can have multiple implementations of the service.

-We create a service package and create a product service interface.
-We create a product service implementation class - FakeProductService.
- Every method in the controller will have a corresponding method with the same name preferably in the service.
